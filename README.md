SafeSpace: Anonymous Mental Health Support Bot for Youth

üí° Project Overview
SafeSpace is an AI-powered, low-data chatbot designed to provide confidential mental health support for young people facing anxiety, abuse, and peer pressure. It addresses the critical problem of youth fearing judgment and lacking accessible avenues for help.

üìå Problem We're Solving
Young people often struggle in silence due to fear of judgment and lack of access to confidential mental health support, leading to worsening conditions and unreported incidents.

üß™ Our Solution
SafeSpace offers an anonymous, accessible chatbot that allows youth to:

Mental Health Check-ins: Engage in empathetic, guided conversations.

Safe Resources: Instantly access vetted helplines and support contacts.

Private Journaling: Securely log thoughts and track mood trends.

Mood Rating: Simple daily mood tracking for self-awareness.

Accessible via WhatsApp or a low-data mobile web interface.

üí∞ Monetization Strategy
SafeSpace is built with a clear path to sustainability and impact:

Schools Pay per User: Annual subscriptions for educational institutions.

Premium Journal Unlock: Advanced journaling features as an upsell.

NGO Partnerships: Funding and licensing from mental health and GBV support organizations.

Incident Analytics Reports: Offering anonymized, aggregated trend data to safety organizations.

üåç Impact & Scalability
Reduces Barriers: Provides accessible, non-judgmental support where it's needed most.

Empowers Youth: Gives a voice to those who might otherwise suffer in silence.

Proactive Care: Helps identify and address mental health challenges early.

Scalable: Designed for low-data environments, adaptable for diverse communities across Africa and globally.

üîß Build Stack (Low-Code + AI)

App Builder: Lovable AI (for rapid UI/backend generation, using React, Vite, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS).
